# My Portfolio V1

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a portfolio of work in order to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

Through this project, I learnt a lot about CSS, styling borders and text, adjusting grid elements to intentionally be of unequal size, adjusting my webpage based on the user's viewport, and how to wrap images within 'a' tags to provide an intuitive user experience.

## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

The page contains the following sections:

'About Me' simply provides general information about who I am, and what I do.

'Work' serves as a showcase for some of my projects thus far; clicking the images of any projects will take you to the deployed application.

'Contact Me' provides contact information for when you will want to get in touch!
